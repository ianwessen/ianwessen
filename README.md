### Howdy, I'm Ian ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer based in San Francisco.

For nearly a decade I've been working on modern web applications with a focus on frontend and design. I'm self-taught, in that I didn't take any computer science or programming classes in university. But I've been blessed with patient friends and mentors along the way who put up with a lot of my questions.

I sometimes freelance as a designer, developer, and calligrapher. For fun I cook, crossword, cycle, wrestle, and write.
