### Howdy, I'm Ian 👋

I'm a software engineer based in San Francisco.

For nearly a decade I've been working on modern web applications with a focus on frontend and design.

I currently work as a Senior Software Engineer at [Carta](https://tribecap.co/1-trillion-in-equity-how-carta-is-set-to-unlock-the-private-markets/), where most of my commit activity lives. This is my personal GitHub where I noodle around on new technology and sometimes contribute to OSS projects.

I occasionally freelance as a designer, developer, and calligrapher. For fun I cook, crossword, cycle, wrestle, and write.
